<p>m currently a second semester Senior at Amherst college. I will be graduating in May 2015, with a Bachelors of Arts in Philosophy.</p>
<p>I am currently writing a thesis on the moral permissibility of joining a standing military. I focus primarily on joining the United States military. Though primarily a philosophy paper, political science, sociology, and black studies have all been increadibly informative. </p> 
<p>During my time here, I have been a member of the debate team, a tour guide, a rugby player, and I have worked in the IT Department.
